### Hey, I'm Adnan Joraid 👋

I'm a computer science student who's passionate about creating meaningful and fun to use technologies. Some technologies I enjoy working with include: ReactJS, Django, Flask, and SwiftUI. I'm most interested in Full-Stack & Backend development.

🌱 I’m currently learning Full-Stack development using Django and ReactJS.
